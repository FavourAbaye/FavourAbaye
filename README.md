- 👋 Hi, I’m @FavourAbaye
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and other front-end library stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that has to do with front-end.
- 📫 How to reach me: fabaye0@gmail.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Football (Pls don't call it Soccer! lol) & Lionel Messi is the Goat. Also I love reading books (fiction mostly & non-fiction too), watching movies or series mostly (kdramas, cdrama etc). I love listening to movies & series soundtrack too.
